# Street Food-Inspired Restaurant Project

## üìå Introduction

Street food is a vibrant part of many cultures across the globe. It's known for being delicious, affordable, and quickly accessible. Street food offers a fun and unique way to enjoy local dishes, often served fresh on bustling streets. However, concerns about hygiene, cleanliness, and comfort often prevent people from fully enjoying these flavors. 

This project aims to bring the street food experience indoors‚Äîoffering the same bold and authentic flavors in a safer, cleaner, and more comfortable restaurant setting.

- Exposure to dust and pollution
- Inconsistent hygiene practices

As studies show (Macrojournal.org, 2023), poor food safety practices increase health risks. A solution is needed that preserves the essence of street food while eliminating these health and comfort concerns.
